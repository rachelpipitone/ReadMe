## My past work
Here is a quick sample of my work I did previously:

```C#
				foreach (string arg in args)
				{

					Console.WriteLine(arg);

				}
                string[] files = new string[3];

                files[0] = args[0];
                files[1] = args[1];



				StreamReader file1 = new StreamReader(args[0] + ".txt");
				StreamReader file2 = new StreamReader(args[1] + ".txt");

				using (FileStream fs = File.Create(args[2] + ".txt"))
				{
					Byte[] info = new UTF8Encoding(true).GetBytes(file1 + file2);
				    
				}

				Console.ReadLine(fs);

```
